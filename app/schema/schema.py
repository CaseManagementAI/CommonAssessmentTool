"""
Schemas for users, candidates, recruiters, admins, and detailed candidate information.

This module defines Pydantic models for the following entities:

- `User`: Represents a user in the system with attributes
          like `name`, `email`, and `role`.
- `Candidate`: Represents a job candidate,
               extending `User` and adding application-specific fields.
- `Recruiter`: Represents a recruiter,
               extending `User` with the ability to create and manage job postings.
- `Admin`: Represents an admin, extending `User` with administrative privileges.
- `DetailedInfo`: Stores detailed information about a candidate,
                  including education, work experience, and personal traits.

The models are used for creating, updating, and responding to API requests and responses.
They leverage Pydanticâ€™s `BaseModel` for data validation and serialization,
including the use of `orm_mode` for mapping data between the database and Pydantic models.

Functions in this module are primarily used to validate
and transform the data for creating or responding to user-related entities in the system.

Classes:
- `UserBase`: Base class for user-related schemas,
              defining common attributes.
- `UserCreate`: Inherits from `UserBase` and
                includes the password and role for creating a user.
- `UserResponse`: Inherits from `UserBase` and
                  includes the `id` for user responses.
- `CandidateBase`: Base class for candidate-related schemas,
                   adding `applicationDate` and `applicationStatus`.
- `CandidateCreate`: Inherits from `CandidateBase` with
                     the addition of `user_id` for creating a candidate.
- `CandidateResponse`: Inherits from `CandidateBase` and
                       includes a nested `user` dictionary for responses.
- `RecruiterBase`: Base class for recruiter-related schemas,
                   extending `UserBase` with `user_id`.
- `RecruiterCreate`: Inherits from `RecruiterBase` and
                     includes the password for creating a recruiter.
- `RecruiterResponse`: Inherits from `RecruiterBase` and
                       includes the `id` for recruiter responses.
- `AdminBase`: Base class for admin-related schemas,
               extending `UserBase`.
- `AdminCreate`: Inherits from `AdminBase` with
                the addition of `password` for creating an admin.
- `AdminResponse`: Inherits from `AdminBase` and
                   includes the `id` for admin responses.
- `DetailedInfoBase`: Base class for detailed information about a candidate.
- `DetailedInfoCreate`: Inherits from `DetailedInfoBase`
                        for creating detailed information records.
- `DetailedInfoResponse`: Inherits from `DetailedInfoBase` and
                          includes the `id` for detailed information responses.

Config Options:
- `from_attributes`: Automatically map attributes from the model during response generation.
- `extra='ignore'`: Ignore extra fields that are not
                    defined in the schema for the `DetailedInfoResponse` model.
