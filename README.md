The CommonAssessmentTool project is a RESTful API-based system designed to manage and process user data. The project includes endpoints for creating, updating, retrieving, and deleting user records, all backed by a SQLite database. 

Core CRUD Functionalities:
Description: Implemented endpoints for creating users (POST /create-user), retrieving all users (GET /users), fetching users by ID (GET /users/{id}), updating user details (PUT /users/{id}), and deleting users (DELETE /users/{id}).

Database Integration and Schema Management:
Description: Designed a structured SQLite database schema to store user data with relevant fields. Added logic to initialize and verify the database schema during the application startup.

Unit and Integration Testing:
Description: Developed a comprehensive suite of tests using pytest and FastAPIâ€™s test client. The tests validate the behavior of all endpoints under various scenarios, including success cases and edge cases (e.g., non-existent user IDs).

Improved Error Handling and Validation:
Description: Standardized error responses and added detailed exception handling for common issues such as invalid user inputs, database constraints, and non-existent records.

These changes enhance the overall stability, scalability, and usability of the CommonAssessmentTool project, providing a strong foundation for managing user data effectively while maintaining a high-quality development process.
